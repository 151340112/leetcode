# The ability to use code to solve problems is very important!!!

-----------------------------------------------------------

### Why should we do algorithm problems

It's undeniable that almost all programmer are API caller(laugh). 
But we use code to solve problems, so we need to improve out **ability** to solve problems with code.

There is a way to improve out ability that do the algorithm problems.

LeetCode is a OJ website that you can use it to practice.

Perhaps you may find that doing algorithm problems is more interesting than usual work.

------------------------------------------------------------

### Why I use cplusplus to solve leetcode problems

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;
```

LeetCode uses the code by default.

If you have joined the NOIP or ICPC, I believe you are familiar with above lines of code.

Right, you can use everything in the c/cpp standara library. 
It's very convenient to solve problems that about algorithm and datastruct.
