### Begin use Python to solve problems

  To be honest, solve some problems by Python can be very simple and convenient,because
the `list` and `dict` is really useful and comfortable.

  For example:

  - operator overload.(Python has a lot of convenient protocol which make your code more simple and elegant)

  - literal representation.(`lst = [1, 2, 3]`, `d = {'foo' : 'bar'}`)
  
  - list derivation and dict derivation. (`l = [x for x in other]`, `d = {key: value for key, value in other.items()}`)
  
  - etc.
  
  Above all, we'd better use suitable data structure to solve the problems.
